 * @name getSupabaseBearerClient
 * @description Creates a Supabase server-side client authenticated via a bearer JWT
 * (no cookies). Used by `enhanceRouteHandler` when an `Authorization: Bearer` header
 * is present — i.e. mobile / native API consumers that hold their session in
 * SecureStore rather than cookies.
 *
 * The JWT is attached as a global request header so every PostgREST call carries
 * the user's identity; RLS continues to enforce access exactly as it does for
 * cookie-based callers.
